eBay Machine Learning Competition

As one of the largest e-commerce operations in the world, eBay deals with hundreds of millions of unstructured listings. The challenge is to correctly identify two or more listings as being for the same group, and they call it Product Level Equivalency (PLE). The PLE has a very strict requirement when comparing two products, which is that they must have the exact same specifications. Therefore, building a highly accurate clustering model is the goal of this challenge. This report introduces how we targeted title and attribute columns for data analysis and preprocessing, performed TF-IDF with TruncatedSVD for dimensionality reduction, and clustered the dataset with Hierarchical agglomerative clustering.

•	Led a team of two to build a clustering model to correctly identify product listings on a text dataset with over 1,002,275 samples for the eBay machine learning competition.

•	Performed data pre-processing with data cleaning, feature transformation using TF-IDF, and dimensionality reduction using TSVD on sparse data.

•	Implemented hierarchical agglomerative clustering method and achieved a RI value of 0.999965.
